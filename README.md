# Nectar API Nectar DB

NectarAPI is a microservices-based, integrated meter device management (MDM) and head-end system (HES) tool for prepaid, STSEd2 meters. It is developed to support high availability for small, medium and large utilities and is intended to be deployed on kubernetes or similar orchestrators. NectarAPI allows utilities to generate and decode IEC62055-41 tokens using its internal virtual HSM or a Prism HSM via the Prism Thrift API. In addition, it allows for subscriber, meter and utility management and multiple STS configurations can be managed using the NectarAPI. NectarAPI uses an API-first approach and exposes feature-rich, REST API endpoints that allow for token generation/decoding, subscribers/users/utility management, logging e.t.c. NectarAPI's virtual HSM is IEC62055-41:2018 (STS6) compliant and supports DES (DKGA02) and KDF-HMAC-SHA-256 (DKGA04) as well as STA (EA07) and MISTY1 (EA11).

`nectar-db` is one of the components that may be used to run the NectarAPI. This sets up a postgres database with all required tables and schema required for the NectarAPI. Rather than running this container in a k8s deployment, a postgres database with similar tables and schema may be used.


# Usage

This script can be run independent of the NectarAPI, it is recommended that the nectar-deploy script be used to launch the tokens-service as part of NectarAPI. REST API access may then be available via the [api-gateway](https://github.com/NectarAPI/api-gateway).
